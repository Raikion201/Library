"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks" by Rebecca Skloot is a non-fiction book that chronicles the story of Henrietta Lacks, whose cells were taken without her knowledge in 1951 and became one of the most important tools in medicine: the HeLa cell line. Henrietta Lacks was an African American woman who was being treated for cervical cancer at Johns Hopkins Hospital when samples of her cancerous cells were taken during a biopsy without her consent or knowledge. These cells were found to be unique because they could be kept alive and multiplied outside the body, becoming the first immortal human cell line. The book delves into the impact of Henrietta's cells on medical science, detailing their use in numerous scientific discoveries, including the development of the polio vaccine, cancer research, and various other medical breakthroughs. Despite the significant contributions made by HeLa cells to scientific progress, Henrietta's family remained largely unaware of her cells' legacy for many years. The narrative also explores the ethical implications of medical research, consent, and the exploitation of patients' cells for scientific gain. Skloot also delves into the personal story of Henrietta Lacks, her family's struggles, and their lack of awareness about Henrietta's contribution to science. "The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks" sheds light on issues of ethics, race, and medical research, while honoring Henrietta's legacy and highlighting the complexities of scientific advancement and its impact on individuals and their families.

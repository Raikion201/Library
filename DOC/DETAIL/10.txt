“Capital in the Twenty-First Century” is a book by French economist Thomas Piketty that analyzes wealth and income inequality over centuries, focusing particularly on the period from the 18th century to the present day. Piketty's central argument revolves around the concept of r > g, where "r" represents the rate of return on capital (wealth) and "g" represents the rate of economic growth. He asserts that when the rate of return on capital exceeds the rate of economic growth, inequality tends to increase because wealth accumulates faster than income from labor. The book delves into historical data and economic analysis from various countries to demonstrate how wealth inequality has evolved, highlighting the concentration of wealth among a small portion of the population and the implications for society. Piketty suggests that this concentration of wealth can have adverse effects on democracy and social stability. Furthermore, Piketty proposes policy solutions to address inequality, advocating for measures such as progressive taxation on wealth and inheritance to mitigate the growing wealth gap and promote a more equitable distribution of resources. "Capital in the Twenty-First Century" sparked widespread debate and discussions about economic inequality, offering a comprehensive analysis of historical trends and proposing ideas for addressing the challenges posed by increasing wealth disparities in modern societies.

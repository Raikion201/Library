“Animal Farm” by George Orwell is an allegorical novella that uses animals on a farm to represent the events leading up to the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the subsequent Stalinist era in the Soviet Union. The story begins with the animals on Manor Farm overthrowing their oppressive human owner, Mr. Jones, led by two pigs, Snowball and Napoleon. They establish a society where all animals are equal, governed by the Seven Commandments of Animalism, notably "All animals are equal." Initially, the farm prospers under the animals' governance, but over time, Napoleon, representing Stalin, becomes increasingly authoritarian. He manipulates the commandments to consolidate power, employing propaganda, fear, and force to control the other animals. The ideals of equality and fairness gradually erode as the pigs, particularly Napoleon and his inner circle, adopt human-like behaviors and privileges, betraying the original principles of the rebellion. The Seven Commandments are eventually revised to favor the pigs, showing the corruption of power. The novella serves as a critique of totalitarianism, showing how revolutions aimed at liberation can devolve into dictatorships, often mirroring the very systems they sought to replace. It highlights themes of power, corruption, manipulation, and the dangers of totalitarian regimes through its animal allegory.

The story revolves around the Bennet family, particularly Elizabeth Bennet, the second eldest daughter. Mrs. Bennet is eager to see her five daughters married, as the estate is entailed away from the female line, and she hopes to secure their futures. When a wealthy and eligible bachelor, Mr. Charles Bingley, arrives in the neighborhood, Mrs. Bennet sees an opportunity for one of her daughters to make a good match.

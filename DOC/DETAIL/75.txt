"The Stranger" by Albert Camus is a philosophical novel that explores the absurdity of life and the alienation of the protagonist, Meursault, from societal norms and expectations. The story follows Meursault, a detached and indifferent young man living in French Algiers, who becomes embroiled in a senseless murder. Key elements of the novel include: Absurdity of Existence: Camus presents the idea of the absurdâ€”the inherent lack of meaning or rationality in life. Meursault's detachment and indifference toward societal conventions reflect his struggle with the absurdity of existence. Alienation and Indifference: Meursault's emotional detachment and inability to conform to societal norms make him an outsider, leading to his isolation and alienation from society. The Murder: The central event of the novel is Meursault's seemingly senseless murder of an Arab man on a beach. Meursault's lack of remorse and inability to provide a coherent motive for the murder challenge societal expectations and norms regarding morality and human behavior. Trial and Consequences: Meursault's trial and subsequent condemnation reflect the clash between his nonconformity and society's need for conformity and logical explanations. His existential outlook and indifference toward conventional emotions lead to his tragic fate. "The Stranger" is a thought-provoking exploration of existentialism, absurdity, and the human condition. Camus's portrayal of Meursault's detached and apathetic perspective invites readers to contemplate the nature of existence, morality, and the societal constructs that govern human behavior.
